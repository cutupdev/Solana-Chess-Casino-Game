# Solana Chess Casino Game

This is chess game on the Solana blockchain. As a play-to-earn game, I have implemented smart contract for security. Solana program was built by Anchor framework and UI is built by react.js. I have implemented only UI and smart contract here, but for full working website, backend is also possible.
